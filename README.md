# **Assignment Summary**  

This project consists of four main components related to image processing techniques, including the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and Corner Detection. The assignment is structured across multiple Jupyter notebooks and a handwritten report.  

## **Contents**  

### **1. Report (report.pdf)**  
- Contains handwritten solutions to **Question 1** and **Question 2**, covering the theoretical aspects of the **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)** and **Corner Detection**.  

### **2. Code Files (assignment.zip)**  
The **assignment.zip** folder contains three Jupyter notebooks corresponding to different questions. The recommended execution environment is **Google Colab**.  

#### **Q1.ipynb (Optimal Sigma for Square - Q1.3)**  
- Implements the **experimental approach** to determine the optimal scale \( \sigma \) for detecting a black square using the Laplacian of Gaussian.  
- The notebook prompts the user to upload an image for testing.  

#### **Q3.ipynb (Histogram of Oriented Gradients - Q3.3, Q3.4)**  
- Implements **HOG feature extraction and visualization**, including magnitude thresholding, gradient direction histograms, and quiver plots.  
- The notebook requires image uploads based on specific sections:  
  - **image1.png** for Image 1  
  - **image2.png** for Image 2  
  - **NoFlash.jpg** for the NoFlash section  
  - **Flash.jpg** for the Flash section  

#### **Q4.ipynb (Corner Detection - Q4.3, Q4.4)**  
- Implements **corner detection using the second moment matrix and eigenvalue analysis**.  
- Computes eigenvalues, generates scatter plots, applies thresholding, and visualizes detected corners.  
- The user is prompted to upload the two required images: **I1 and I2**.  

## **Instructions**  
1. Extract the `assignment.zip` folder.  
2. Open **Google Colab** and upload the required Jupyter notebook.  
3. Follow the upload prompts for images where necessary.  
4. Run all cells in sequence to generate results.
